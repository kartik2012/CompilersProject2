Program 2
Due: 9/30/2016
Compilers

How to invoke the program:
1. "make clean"
2. "make"
3. "make test"

Assumptions made while coding:
    I didn't really make that many "assumptions." The procedure was fairly straight-forward

Problems I ran into:
    I was quite unsure of exactly what specific tests needed to be made on P2.Java. I assumed this was primarily for our testing purposes, so I compensated by creating as many tests as I needed.
